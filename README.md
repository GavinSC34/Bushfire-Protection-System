Climate change challenges homeowners to face the reality of increasingly frequent and
intense bushfires. To avoid major loss of life, the advice from the fire service, police and planners
is to evacuate. Take what you can, leave your house, and hope fire fighters can cope. And often,
they can't cope. 

The project aims to protect the house from bushfire when we are told to leave.
Spraying systems can be actived, by the homeowner, or automatically.
Loss of mains electricity and internet is common in major fires and is addressed.

Detailed information is given in the project files. 
Temperature and smoke sensors, as well as press button and Blynk, can start spraying.

The author lives in a rural area of Tasmania, Australia. He was a volunteer fire fighter for 15 years
and worked extensively on fire safety for the home through a community fireguard program.

Development of the concept is welcomed.
